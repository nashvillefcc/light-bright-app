# Light Bright Web App

This application is a simple recreation of the classic [Lite-Brite toy](https://googlethatforyou.com?q=lite-brite) which can be played in the browser. We will be using HTML, CSS, and JS for development, without any framework dependencies.

## Goals

Currently, we are primarily in the design phase of development for this application. Open design and development issues can be found on the [project board](https://github.com/nashvillefcc/light-bright-app/projects/1) of our repo.

MVP design document can be found here: TODO (include link to design doc)

Our current design mockup can be found here: https://www.figma.com/file/QQ1lUDGRm0nNJqZdisO519/Light-Bright?node-id=0%3A1

## Installation

Clone or fork the repo to your local machine, and use your editor of choice for development. We recommend VS Code for beginners. We are only using HTML, CSS, and JS for development, without any framework dependencies.

Currently the application is not being hosted online, so you will need a local server for development and testing. The Live Server extension in VS Code may be helpful.
